# Web and Mobile App Development - SMIT Batch 12 Assignments

Welcome to my repository for all assignments and projects related to the Web and Mobile App Development course. This repo will serve as a central hub for all my coursework, organized by module and subject.

## Repository Structure

- **[HTML Assignments](./HTML-Assignments/)**: All assignments related to HTML.
- **[CSS Assignments](./CSS-Assignments/)**: All assignments focused on CSS.
- **[JavaScript Assignments](./JS-Assignments/)**: JavaScript-related assignments.
- **More Modules Coming Soon!**: As the course progresses, I'll be adding more folders for new subjects like TypeScript, React, Next JS, Node.js, MongoDB, and more.

## How to Navigate

- **Assignments**: Each folder contains individual assignments. Inside, you’ll find all the necessary files, such as `index.html`, stylesheets, JavaScript files, and any other required resources.
- **Future Modules**: As I advance through the course, I'll create additional folders for new topics. These will be organized similarly to the current structure, making it easy to find specific assignments or projects.

## Why This Repo?

This repository is a way for me to track my learning journey, keep my work organized, and share my progress. It’s a work in progress, just like my skills!

## Upcoming Topics

As the course curriculum is extensive, expect to see folders and assignments on a variety of topics beyond just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Some upcoming topics may include:

- TypeScript
- FireBase
- React.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Express.js
- And more!
